It is true, judgment against your evil works has not been executed before; the floods of God's vengeance have been withheld: but your guilt in the meantime is constantly increasing, and you are every day storing up more wrath: the waters are constantly rising, and growing more and more mighty, and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God that holds the waters back that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go forward. If God should only withdraw His hand from the floodgate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand times greater than it is, yes, ten thousand times greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would never be able to withstand or endure it.</div>

However, you may now be unconvinced of the truth that you now hear, in time you will be fully convinced of it. Those that were in similar circumstances as you are, are now gone and destruction came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing to happen and while they were saying, Peace and safety; now they see that those things on which they depended on peace and safety were nothing but on thin air and empty shadows. </div>

You have offended Him infinitely more than ever stubborn rebel did his prince: and yet, it is nothing but His hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell last night, that you were allowed to awake up again in this world, after you closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given, why you have not dropped into hell since you arose this morning, but that God's hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat at here in this church, provoking His pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending His solemn worship Yes, there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment crop down into hell.</div>

You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe, and burn it apart; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath. nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment.</div>

      <b><h3>Literary Focus</h3> </b>
      <p>
         <b><h5>LITERARY DEVICES IN 18TH CENTURY SERMONS </h5></b>
      <div class="a">A poem, a novel, or a play might easily be considered as literature by anyone as these are the common literary forms in contemporary times. The sermon' s literary qualities, on the other hand, might not be very evident but they also make use of different literary techniques such as figures of speech which give it it’s literary quality. Thus, similar to any literary text, 18th century sermons may also be analyze for its imagery, symbolism and figures of speech.</div>
      <div class="d">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" is an example of an 18th century sermon that is rich in figurative language. The author's use of such device is careful, clear, and meaningful. Study some of the literary devices used in the text:</div>
      <ul>
         <li>Imagery is creating mental pictures that appeal to the five senses of the reader.</li>
         <ul type=square>
            <li><i>Visual</i> (appeals to the sense of sight): "They stand waiting for them, like greedy hungry Lion that see their Prey, and expect to have it, but are for the present kept back" </li>
            <li><i>Olfactory</i> (appeals to the sense of smell): "the flesh burnt in the pit of hell”</li>
            <li><i>Gustatory</i> (appeals to the sense of taste): "one can have a rational sense of the sweetness of honey, but the true sense of its taste can only be attained through experience.</li>
            <li><i>Auditory</i> (appeals to the sense of hearing)."but when once Day of Mercy is past, your most with lamentable and dolorous Cries and Shrieks will vain”</li>
            <li><i>Tactile</i> (appeals to the sense of touch)"Fire is made ready, the Furnace is now hot”</li>
            <li><i>Kinesthetic</i> (appeals to the sense of motion or movement) “as one that stands or walks in slippery Places is always exposed to fall”
         </ul>
         <li>Symbolism is the use of images (object or actions) that  represent something else. Often, the symbols used possess universal or cultural value or meaning.</li>
         Examples:
         <ul type=square>
            <li>The cross is a symbol of religion.</li>
            <li>The snake is a symbol of temptation</li>
            <li>The dragon is symbol of threat for the West but it symbolizes protection and luck for the East. </li>
         </ul>
         <li>Figurative of speech are words or phrases that are used to create a specialized meaning that is not based on the literal meaning of the words.</li>
         <ul type=square>
            <li><i>Personification</i> (using qualities, capabilities, and features of a person to nonliving thing): “Justice calls aloud for an infinite Punishment of their Sin”</li>
            <li><i>Similie</i> (indirect comparison using the word like and as)”: “your Destruction would come like a Whirlwind”</li>
            <li><i>Metaphor</i> (direct comparison of two unrelated ideas or things): “God is an archer”</li>
            <li><i>Hyperbole</i> (an obvious exaggeration): “Millions die every second because of sins.”
         </ul>
         <li>Rhetorical devices</li>
         <ul type=square>
            <li><i>Alliteration</i> (repetition of initiation consonant sounds): “sweet summer sins”</li>
            <li>Consonance (Repetition of initial consonant sound in two or more times in all syllables of each word): “priest who tap on people”</li>
            <li>Assonance (repetition of the same vowel sound in the two or more times in all syllables of each word): “another anti-war party”</li>
            <li>Anaphora (repetition of words or phrase in succession) (e.g., Come live with me and be my love in the pastoral poem The Passionate Shepherd to His Love)</li>
         </ul>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <div class="a">Figurative language, like the use of imagery, symbolisms, figures of speech, or rhetorical devices, makes the literary text relatable to the readers. Sometimes, the representation of an unfamiliar idea using a common illustration is the key to understanding figurative language does not complicate the text, instead, it cushions understanding by means of comparisons and relations. </div>
      <ol>
         Identify what figurative language is used in the following lines of the poem "The Dream of the Rood”
         <li>bent and begun to bleed</li>
         <li>the best of dreams/ Which came to me the middle of one night</li>
         <li>sky suffused with light</li>
         <li>Changing its clothes and hues; sometimes it was</li>
         <li>enemies there fastened </li>
         <li>Darkness covered the Ruler’s corpse with clouds</li>
         <li>All creation wept</li>
         <li>The soldiers left me standing drenched with moisture</li>
         <li>they pierced me with dark with nails</li>
         <li>Christ was on the cross </li>

      <p>
         <h4><b>GETTING INFORMATION FROM BROCHURES, PAMPHLETS, AND PERIODICALS </b></h4>
      <div class="a">Informational materials such as brochures, pamphlets, leaflets, and periodicals provide quick and handy information. Knowing the differences among these materials may help you identify the kind of information that you will expect from each. </div>
      <ol>
         <li>A <b>brochure</b> is a reference material that usually has four to six panels. It is intended to be kept for present and future reference. The contents of a brochure are usually factual details of an institution, a business company, or an organization; thus, these are not intended to be replaced often. You can see brochures distributed in schools upon enrollment or placed at the entrance or lobbies of hotels banks, and offices.</li>
         <li>A <b>pamphlet</b> is an unbound booklet that has at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of cover pages. These pages aim to educate, inform, persuade or entertain, advertise, and campaign.</li>
         <li>A <b>periodical</b> is a document with consistent schedule and frequency of publication. Newsletters, journals, gazettes, digests, and magazines are all periodicals. Periodicals contain updated information that may help the distributor to achieve his or her goals. For example, companies that regularly distribute newsletters give you the impression that their business is doing well and is actively finding means to serve you better.</li>
         <li>A <b>flyer</b> is a piece of paper that is intended for easy information handling. This is used to provide the gist of an event, organization or concept, with the assumption that the people who will read it will ask further information. They are way" such that, after one reads the information, it can be discarded. Promotions like events, product information, or conferences are usually delivered by flyers.</li>
         <li>A <b>leaflet</b> is just like a flyer, but is printed out on a bigger paper or printed in color and aims to catch longer attention of the target audience. Leaflets may be inserted in local newspapers or may just be left in places where the target audience will most likely see.</li>

         <h4><b>WRITING A DISCURSIVE PAPER</b></h4>
      <div class="a"> A <b>discursive paper</b> is a text that presents an objective and balanced explanation of a given topic Although neutral, the paper does not express its neutrality explicitly by stating a writer, I am neutral about the subject because of the following reasons. A discursive paper examines the subject objectively and distances the author from the paper itself. The opinion of the author does not matter much because the goal is not to influence the readers of the author's preference, but to carefully examine two sides of an issue.</div>
      <div class = "d"><table>
      <table border=1
         bordercolor=steelblue
         align=center>
         <tr>
            <th bgcolor=steelblue style="color:white;">
               <center>

               What makes anyone intelligent is the awareness of what and how to think about the subject he or she deals with.

      <div class="a">A Discursive paper is basically comprised of three elements: arguments for the issue, arguments against issue, and balanced treatment of the issue. Similar to any other type of essay, it should also have a good introduction, body and conclusion.</div>
      <ul>
         <li>A good introduction aside from introduction the topic, gives some background about the topic. Quotations and anecdotes are also helpful to get the attention of the readers.</li>
         <li>The body must present the arguments both for and against the issue. It is also good to have a balance presentation of both sides of the argument.</li>
         <li>A good conclusion should contain no new information; although, it may contain the personal opinion of the writer on the issue.</li>
         <li>Additionally, remember that effective discursive essays must be balanced, organized, and clear.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         Take note of the three C's in writing a discursive paper.
         <li><i>Correct</i>. You have to make sure that the information you provide are correct. Research on the things that you want to discuss before actually writing them. If you aim to actually present a balanced paper, the quality of information for both sides must be secured.</li>
         <li><i>Concise</i>. A lengthy paper does not mean a meaty one. Being concise helps your readers understand the point of your paper with lesser chances of misrepresenting data. Conciseness also shows how well versed you are in expressing yourself.</li>
         <li><i>Clear</i>. What is the use of a well-researched paper expressed at a reasonable length if the meaning is not clear?' Clarity is important so that the readers will understand your point(s). You can achieve this by using appropriate diction, correct transition, and adequate examples in the discussion.</li>
      </ul>
